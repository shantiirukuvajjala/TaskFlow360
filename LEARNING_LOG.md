# TaskFlow360 â€“ Learning & Development Log

This project reflects a consistent and focused upskilling journey on modern .NET backend architecture. Although the code was recently pushed to GitHub, the concepts and implementation were developed incrementally over time.

## ðŸ“… Timeline Summary

| Period              | Activity |
|---------------------|----------|
| Feb 2024 â€“ Apr 2025 | Explored and practiced Clean Architecture, CQRS, MediatR, and modern .NET backend design through self-guided learning and practice |
| Apr 2025            | Created the TaskFlow360 repository and began structuring the backend based on best practices |
| May 2025            | Finalized the solution and pushed it to GitHub to demonstrate backend expertise and readiness for full-stack extension |

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

TaskFlow360 was created to:
- Demonstrate clean API design using .NET 8 and MediatR
- Apply architectural patterns like CQRS and the Repository pattern
- Build a scalable foundation for integration with React frontend and Azure Functions

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated

- Clean Architecture with modular separation (API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- CQRS implementation using MediatR
- In-memory repository abstraction (easily swappable with EF Core or Cosmos DB)
- Swagger for API testing
- Layered design and adherence to SOLID principles


## ðŸ’¬ Final Note

This repository showcases deliberate and well-structured development practices, reflecting ongoing learning and practical application over time.
